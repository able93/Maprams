‚Å´MAPRAMS

INTRODUCTION

Maprams is an application built using the R-framework and can be used to make plots including surface views, cross-sectional views (I-plot, J-plot), zoom plots, and animations from NetCDF files. It is primarily developed to view ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) output files, including their cross-sectional plots at a particular longitude and latitude. 

The depth or vertical stretching at a particular longitude and latitude are calculated following this link: https://www.myroms.org/wiki/Vertical_S-coordinate. The data for the plots are sliced or generated using the ocean_time and level (for ROMS file) or from the third and fourth dimensions for other NetCDF files.

DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION

Maprams 1.0 can be downloaded for Windows. Maprams can be downloaded as executable file on:

https://maprams.wixsite.com/maprams/

or it can be used online on:

https://ablelin.shinyapps.io/maprams/

The installation is straightforward. After the executable file is downloaded, the user can right-click and run as administrator or double-click the executable file and allow the application to be installed on the desktop. After a successful installation, the application can be opened from Windows Start.

ERRORS

The user is advised not to tamper with the installation files to avoid errors or application crashes. All errors generated can be documented and forwarded to the developer through email (abrahamabiola3@gmail.com). The errors would be fixed as soon as possible. The users should also look out for subsequent versions that would be released, as they would have addressed bugs and better interfaces for users and other added functions.

HOW TO USE

The user is expected to upload the NetCDF file on the Surface plot tab. The file is first analyzed to know if it is a ROMS output file or not. If it is a ROMS output file, the user can use the Surface plot, Crop Surface Plot, I-plot, J-plot, and Animation to view the surface plots and cross-sectional plots. However, if the file is scanned and not a ROMS output file, the user is advised to use the NetCDF file tab which can handle other types of NetCDF files, as the user can easily specify the parameters to plot. The user is however limited to the use of NetCDF files and Animation.

Maprams is majorly built on the R-framework, R Shiny, the vertical stretching equations by ROMS, and Google Chrome Portable used to develop as a desktop application.
